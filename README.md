These are my solutions to some leetcode problems

## How to use the test cases
Each problem includes a file with some test cases. Although these do not cover all possible cases, it should be enough to test each problem.

Just compile the `.cpp` file with and paste the contents of the `testCases` file in the terminal. Feel free to use these test cases or the main program and functions for your own solutions. New test cases are welcome :) .
